## Notebook 1: Stock_forecasting_simple.ipynb

The first notebook allows you to make predictions about the trend of a specific stock based on user-selected parameters. These parameters include the start and end date for data observation and the number of days for prediction.

## Notebook 2: Stock_forecasting_with_GUI.ipynb

The second notebook offers the same forecasting functionalities but includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI allows for interactive parameter input and also displays additional information such as the latest balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and the latest news on the selected stock.
